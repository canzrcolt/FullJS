React is a javascript library

- React manipulates the DOM and doesn't want you to because it can do it faster. You make a blueprint for how the DOM should be manipulated

- React is based off of components that are like blocks

- There is a unidirectional data flow that doesn't allow anything higher in the heirachy to be affected when something in the lower part changes

- Non-Opinioned unlike angular

- you give state (which is like data?) and components with props to react to create a virtualdom

- the react library uses the virtualdom you created to manipulate the dom

- jsx is the syntax used that is combination of JS and html
