Spread is like Unpacking and array.    source 09-data-structures-operators

spread operator takes everything out of an array and makes a new one. it can join arrays
it can also take all the elements out of an array. 
it can also copy an array
in ES2018 you can actually make it deal with objects and it's amazing

**Make sure you only use commas when dealing with spread operator. ${} won't work, and neither will adding(concatenating)
